      From the **Configuration** menu, click **View System Log**.  
  
The System Log tracks software errors and provides detail on each fault. Click each Log Message to view error details.  
  
There is a limit set with the [Setting](default.aspx?pageid=settings): **System.MaxLogEntries** that is set to 250 entries by default. When this limit is reached, the log will no longer populate entries. Increase the value for the Setting, or clear the log to allow room for new entries. You can **Export** the current log entries to a .txt file for archiving if you wish, and then click the **Clear System Log** button to empty the log.
