      1stPay is an 'embedded' payment option, meaning that while as far as your customer can tell they never leave your site, the payment details are actually being entered into the 1stPay gateway's site directly through the use of an iframe.

To enable the 1stPay payment gateway:

1.  In the \[Company Name\] admin console, go to **Configuration > Site Setup Wizard**.  
      
    
2.  In the Payment Gateway section, click the **configure** link next to the 1stPay entry.  
      
    
3.  Enter the values you obtained from 1stPay for the **Transaction Center Id**, **Gateway Id**, and **Processor Id**.

5.  Finally, click the radio button next to **1stPay** and then click the **Save** button.
