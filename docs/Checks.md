      ---

      Checks are very rarely used for online transactions, but they can be enabled if desired. Note that if you decide to use this method, you need to make sure that, the address to send payment to is prominently displayed on your site and the receipt.

1.  In the \[Company Name\] admin console, go to **Configuration > Site Setup Wizard** and check the box next to Checks in the Credit Cards & Other Payment Methods section, then click **Save**.  
      
    
2.  It will then be shown in the Payment Info page as one of the payment methods.
