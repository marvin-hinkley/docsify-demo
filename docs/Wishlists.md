      The wishlist allows customers to save a list of products they want to buy later. A product added to the wishlist is not deducted from inventory until the product is moved to the shopping cart and purchased.

Enabling the Wishlist

DisallowAnonCustomersToCreateWishlist

Using the Wishlist
==================

When a customer clicks **Add to Wish List**, the product is added to the wishlist instead of the normal shopping cart.
