      MaxMind is a 3rd-party service that uses geolocation tools and other tests to check online orders for fraud. MaxMind does not actually verify cardholder information (this is left to the payment gateway), it instead focuses on verifying that the cardholder is actually the person making the online transaction. It is completely separate from the payment gateway, and serves as an extra level of security above your gateway's standard checks.   
  
See [http://www.maxmind.com](http://www.maxmind.com/app/ccv_buynow?rId=aspdnsf) for more information on how the service works and pricing.   
  

**Thresholds** 
===============

MaxMind's service works by assigning each transaction a fraud score, with 0.0 being very low risk and 100.0 being the highest risk. Store admins must set several 'threshold' Settings (explained below) to determine how the software should handle orders based on that score. The default values for those Settings are simply recommendations based on information from MaxMind, store admins should feel free to adjust the values based on their business model and fraud rates.
