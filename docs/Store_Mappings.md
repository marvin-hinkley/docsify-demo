The Store Mappings page allows you to determine which entities on your store can be used/displayed on which of your configured stores on \[Company Name\]. Available entities that can be mapped from this page are:   

*   Affiliates
*   Categories

*   Order Options
*   Products

Before using Store Mappings, make sure you've set up at least one [MoreStore](default.aspx?pageid=adding_a_morestore).  
  
First, select an entity from the **Entity** dropdown menu. Then, select a store to map to from the **Store** dropdown menu.
