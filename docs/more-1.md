      What does "Hide" mean?
======================

If the owner of an AspDotNetStorefront store uses the configuration setting "HideProductsWithLessThanThisInventoryLevel", and sets it to a value that is other than '-1', then the storefront checks the inventory level of the default variant on every product and if the value (of stock in hand) is less than the value in "HideProductsWithLessThanThisInventoryLevel", then the entire product is hidden, even if other variants are in stock.
