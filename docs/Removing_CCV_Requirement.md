      title: Removing CCV Requirement
      ---

      Some [payment gateways](default.aspx?pageid=payment_gateways) do not require the CCV code, and store administrators will not want to collect that information when it isn't necessary. The CCV requirement can be removed, making that an optional field during the checkout process. To do this, simply set the **CardExtraCodeisOptional** [Setting](default.aspx?pageid=settings) to **Yes**.
