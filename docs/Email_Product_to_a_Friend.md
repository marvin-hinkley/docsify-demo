      title: Email Product to a Friend
      ---

      This feature gives store customers the ability to recommend your products to other people. This will also help promote your site. Before this feature can be used, your store needs to be configured to send email. For more information on email setup, please see [this page](default.aspx?pageid=email_setup).

Setup
=====

1.  In the \[Company Name\] admin console, go to Configuration > Settings.  
      
    
2.  Set **ShowEmailProducttoFriend** to yes, then click **Refresh Store**.

You can also control the design of the email that the potential customers will receive according to your store’s needs. To edit, locate the **notification.emailproduct.xml.config** in the XmlPackages folder. In editing the format of the email for potential customers, it is advisable that the one who will do the changes is knowledgeable in XML programming.

  
When configured, shoppers will find a link on the product page to email the details to a friend:
