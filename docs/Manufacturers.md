      From the **Products Menu**, click **Product Groups**, then click **Manufacturers**.  
  
Manufacturers are a way of organizing your products so that customers can browse your site more easily, similar to categories and departments. When adding a new product to the store, one of the required fields is the Manufacturer.  
  
New Manufacturers can be added by clicking **Create Manufacturer** on the Product Groups page, or by using the **Quick Add** feature when adding a new product or editing an existing product.

To create a new manufacturer, click **Create Manufacturer**. To create a sub-manufacturer of another manufacturer, click the **\+ Add** button in the parent manufacturer row. See [this page](page.aspx?pageid=product_groups) for an explanation of all of the fields that can be set for each manufacturer.

To assign a product to a manufacturer, open that product under **[Products > Manage Products](page.aspx?pageid=manage_products)**, open the product in the grid view and use the Manufacturer dropdown on the Main tab to set the product's manufacturer.
