      title: Failed Transactions
      ---

      From the **Orders** menu, click **Manage Orders**, then click **Failed Transactions**.  
  
Transactions that fail to process due to bank declines, invalid credit card information, or an error from the payment gateway are listed here. The customer's information as well as the transaction information that was sent to the gateway and the response the gateway returned are all listed here. This information can be useful in determining why an order failed.
