      title: Accepting Orders Without Collecting Payment Info
      ---

      Set up the store to collect orders without forcing the customer to enter payment information. This could be used for catalog-type sites, event registrations, etc.   
  
To accept orders without collecting payment info:

1.  All Products will need to be created with $0 prices at the Product Variant level.

2.  You may wish to set them all to **Hide Price Until Cart** on the parent product level so that product detail pages do not display this price label.

3.  Then set the **SkipPaymentEntryOnZeroDollarCheckout** [Setting](default.aspx?pageid=settings) to **Yes**.
