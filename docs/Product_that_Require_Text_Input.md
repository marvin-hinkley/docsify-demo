      title: Product that Require Text Input
      ---

      This will allow customers to enter custom text for inscriptions, engravings, etc.  
  
Set the **Requires Text Field** [attribute](default.aspx?pageid=manage_products) for that product to **Yes** to enable a required text field on the product detail page. The field will be named "Customization Text" (see [Prompt](http://help.aspdotnetstorefront.com/manual/1000/default.aspx?pageid=prompts): common.cs.70 ) by default unless you enter a field name to display to your customers in the **Field Prompt** attribute. You can also specify a maximum length for the value entered by the customer in the text field (Max Length attribute).

On the product detail page, shoppers can enter their own custom text before they add the product to the cart:

NOTE: Entering a Field Prompt value and leaving the Requires Text Field attribute to **No** will display an optional text field on the product detail page.
