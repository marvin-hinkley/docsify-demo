      title: XML Product Import
      ---

      From **Products** Menu, click **Import/Export**, then click **XML Product Import**  
  
On this page (as well as [this one](default.aspx?pageid=import_export)), products can be imported in bulk. This page requires those products to be in an XML file, formatted like [this sample file](docs/XmlImport.zip).   
  
**When an import file is processed, the software looks at each entry and compares it to existing products in the storefront. If the SKU of a product in the import file matches an existing product, that existing product is updated with the information from the new file. If there is no SKU match, then a new product is created with that information.**   
  
To import a new product list, use the **Choose File** button to locate the import file, then click **Upload**.

Once the file has been processed (this can take a while if it is a large import file), the screen below will be shown. It is a good idea to click the **View Import Log** link and make sure that there are no errors showing. If everything looks ok, click the **Click Here to Accept Import** button to complete the process. If there are problems showing in the log file, or you wish to cancel the import, click the **Click Here to Undo the Import** button.
