      title: Setup (Content)
      ---

      "Content". It is such a widely used term, and covers such a breadth of meaning when it comes to a storefront. In a brick-and-mortar store, the 'content' is the shelving, and the products that go on the shelves, and the signage, and the staff.  
  
In an online store, 'content' is the products, and their groupings, and the customers (their email addresses, and shipping details etc) and your orders, and your inventory. More, though ~ it's also the pages you write (like 'About Us') and your policies, and your settings, and your screen prompts. It's your images, and your watermarks, and your disclaimers and your sitemap!  
  
In this help console, we try to help you manage your content.
