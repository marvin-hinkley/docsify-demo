      From the **Products Menu**, click **Product Groups**.  
  
Categories are a way of organizing your products so that customers can browse your site more easily, similar to manufacturers and departments. It is not absolutely necessary to use categories, but most sites are going to be improved by this kind of organization.

To create a new category, click **Create Category**. To create a sub-category of another category, click the **\+ Add** button in the parent category row. See [this page](default.aspx?pageid=product_groups) for an explanation of all of the fields that can be set for each category.

To assign a product to a category, open that product under **[Products > Manage Products](default.aspx?pageid=manage_products)**, open the product in the grid view and click on the **Mappings** tab. Check the boxes next to the Categories you'd like the product to appear in and click **Save**.

Optionally, sub-categories can be displayed in a grid with images by changing the [Setting](default.aspx?pageid=settings) **ShowSubCatsInGrid** to **Yes**.  
  
Once this is set, the sub-category list will be replaced with a grid with sub-category images as shown below:
