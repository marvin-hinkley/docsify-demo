      title: Edit Countries
      ---

      From the **Configuration** Menu, click **Edit Countries**   
  
On this page, store administrators can set up tax rates based on the country with which the customer registers. Taxes can also be based on the [state](default.aspx?pageid=edit_states_provinces) or the [zip code](default.aspx?pageid=tax_by_post_code) customers specify.

If multiple levels of taxes are set up (e.g. state and zip code), customers are charged the cumulative amount.

Adding a Country
================

The store comes preloaded with a list of the countries that do the most online business, but does not contain every country. More countries can be added, by clicking the **Create** button.

The list of countries on this page is what is used to generate the Country drop-down lists customers see when creating addresses on the front end. If you want to enable customers to choose a new country, add the country on this page as shown below. If you want to remove countries from your site's drop-down lists, delete them from this page.
