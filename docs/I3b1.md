      Why does Google say 'not yet searchable'?
=========================================

If Google is fed an item that is marked 'out of stock' then Google is smart enough to know that the inventory can change suddenly and jump back into stock. Therefore 'out of stock' products are not rejected or disapproved. Instead they are marked 'not yet searchable' and moved in and out of the search results as inventory values allow.
