      title: Tax by Zip Code
      ---

      From the **Configuration** Menu, click **Taxes by Zip Code**.  
  
On this page, store administrators can set up tax rates based on the zip code the customer registers with. Taxes can also be based on the [state](default.aspx?pageid=edit_states_provinces) or the [country](default.aspx?pageid=edit_countries) customers specify.

If multiple levels of taxes are set up (ie state and zip code), the customer will be charged the cumulative amount.
