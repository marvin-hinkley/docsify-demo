      What does "Rules" mean?
=======================

Whenever attributes are used, Google asks for us to break up variants (which are core to AspDotNetStorefront) into 'items'. For example, if a product is a t-shirt, and there are two variants (one is round-necked and one is v-necked) and each variant comes in red and in blue and in large and in small, then that product becomes eight items (that's two variants, each with four combos of size/color).

Because AspDotNetStorefront stores variants, DotFeed can process rules against them. For the time-being, however, there is no way to apply rules to these 'items' that DotFeed creates.

This column is designed to show you whether or not rules can be used to change data while it is on its way to Google.
