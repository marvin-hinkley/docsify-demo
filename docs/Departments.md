      From the **Products Menu**, click **Product Groups**, then click **Departments**.   
  
Departments are a way of organizing your products so that customers can browse your site more easily, similar to manufacturers and categories. It is not absolutely necessary to use departments, but most sites are going to be improved by this kind of organization.

To create a new department, click **Create Department**. To create a sub-department of another department, click the **\+ Add** button in the parent department row. See [this page](default.aspx?pageid=product_groups) for an explanation of all of the fields that can be set for each department.

To assign a product to a department, open that product under **[Products > Manage Products](default.aspx?pageid=manage_products)**, open the product in the grid view and click on the **Mappings** tab. Check the boxes next to the Departments you'd like the product to appear in and click **Save**.
