      Why does this variant get fed to Google?
========================================

This variant is not showing up on Store 2, so why is it being fed to Google? Surely Google doesn't want to know about products that are marked 'non-display'?

Google absolutely does NOT want to mark this product as searchable. Google does NOT want users to find an item on Google's shopping engine but 'click' and find no matching product to buy.

We therefore urge you to use DotFeed rules to set the availability of such products as 'out of stock', which will result in Google marking them 'not yet searchable'. When your stock levels recover, Google can be advertising for you in a matter of hours.
