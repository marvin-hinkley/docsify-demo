      Why doesn't this variant show up on Store 2 ... ?
=================================================

... because Store 2 has configured the store to hide products where the **default variant** (which in this case is Variant V-2b) has a stock level of less than 6. Therefore, even though variant V-2a has more than 6 in stock, the product is ruled by the default and V-2a gets to stay on the shelves until more of V-2b comes available!
