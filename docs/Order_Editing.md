      title: Order Editing
      ---

      By default, once a customer places an order it cannot be edited. If changes need to be made, an [ad-hoc charge/refund](default.aspx?pageid=order_processing) has to be made to adjust the order total. If desired, store administrators can enable the order editing feature, which allows them to edit almost all elements of completed orders.

Different industries and gateways have different rules on editing completed orders. Check with a professional advisor for the requirements for your site.

Enabling Order Editing
======================

To enable this feature, simply set the OrderEditingEnabled [Setting](default.aspx?pageid=settings) to true.

Editing an Order
================

To edit an order, find it under [Orders > Manage Orders](default.aspx?pageid=view_manage_orders) and click the **Edit** button.

Next, you will be able to navigate the site within a mini-browser window and add/remove items from the cart, similar to [creating a new order](default.aspx?pageid=phone_orders) from the admin console.

Which Orders can be Edited
==========================

To qualify to be edited, orders must:

*   Not be CAPTURED
*   Not contain gift cards
*   Not be an Admin User order
*   Not have recurring items
*   Not have been previously edited
*   Not have had the download email sent (if a digital product)
