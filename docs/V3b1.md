      Why does this variant show up on Store 4 ... ?
==============================================

... because 'Track Inventory by size and color' is turned on. In AspDotNetStorefront, the in-stock values of all the 'items' in the default variant are added together, and if the total is greater than the value in the 'OutofStockThreshold' then the variant will be displayed.
