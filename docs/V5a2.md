      Why is an out of stock variant being fed ...?
=============================================

... because the owner of Store 3 has elected to display this variant (albeit with an "out of stock" message) on his store, and so it seems likely that the product will soon be back in stock. Google takes a matter of some days to re-approve products if they are dropped from a feed, so instead DotFeed keeps feeding the variant, but the store-owner has complete freedom to set the 'availability' to 'out of stock'.
