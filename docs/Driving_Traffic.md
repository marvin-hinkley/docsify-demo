No single task is more important than driving  traffic to an online store. Marketers talk about the 'cost of acquisition' of visitors and there are certainly many free (and not-so-free) ways to attract traffic to your store. The key, always, is to make sure that the visitors you attract are actively looking for the products that you sell. That's why we usually qualify this as 'targeted traffic'.   
  
Keywords (often referred to as 'relevance terms') are the key to success. AspDotNetStorefront is speicifically geared to help you to position your key words and phrases strategically so that search engines and product feeds are made aware of the ways they can match your products to targeted shoppers.
