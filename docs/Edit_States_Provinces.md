      title: Edit States/Provinces
      ---

      From the **Configuration** Menu, click **Edit States/Provinces**   
  
On this page, store administrators can set up tax rates based on the state/province the customer registers with. Taxes can also be based on the [country](default.aspx?pageid=edit_countries) or the [zip code](default.aspx?pageid=tax_by_post_code) customers specify.

If multiple levels of taxes are set up (ie state and zip code), the customer will be charged the cumulative amount.

Adding a State/Province
=======================

**

\[Company Name\] comes preloaded with the US and Canadian states/provinces. More states can be added, by clicking the **Add New** button.

The list of states on this page is what is used to generate the state dropdown menus customers see when creating addresses on the front end. If you need a new state to appear there, add it here. If you want to remove states from those menus, delete them from this page.
