      title: Cloning Products
      ---

      Cloning a product makes a copy of it with every attribute except the name set to exactly the same as the original product. The name is the same as the original with " - CLONED" added to the end. This is an easy way to create multiple products that are mostly identical, by simply cloning the first product and making the small changes that are necessary.   

1.  In the \[Company Name\] admin console, go to **Products > Manage Products**.  
      
    
2.  Find the product that you want to clone in the grid, and click the **Clone** link on the right hand side.
