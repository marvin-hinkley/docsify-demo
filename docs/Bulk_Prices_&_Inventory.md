      title: Bulk Prices & Inventory
      ---

      From the **Products** Menu, click **Prices & Inventory**.  
  
On this page, store administrators can edit variant names, prices, sale prices, inventory levels, and published status in bulk, rather than editing individual products one at a time. For products with multiple variants, each variant will be displayed individually, so all variants can be modified at once. There is also a powerful filter which helps store administrators to easily select the variants they need to edit.  

1.  Use the **Filter** section at the top of the page to search for a list of products to edit. Click **Apply Filter** to apply the filters to the results grid below.

3.  You can also use the Bulk Set Prices feature to apply a discount % to the filtered group of products. Enter a discount % in the **Set Sales Discount** field, and click **Bulk Set Prices**. Sale Price values will be populated with the discounted Price.
