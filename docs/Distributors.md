      From the **Products Menu**, click **Product Groups**, then click **Distributors**.  
  
Distributors can be used as a way of organizing your products to make navigating through your site easier for your customers, similar to departments and categories. Few sites use distributors this way, however, as categories and departments are usually more customer-friendly ways of organizing.

Distributors can also be used as a means of setting up drop shipping, which is very useful for many larger-volume sites. For information on how to set this up, please see [here](default.aspx?pageid=drop_shipping).

To create a new distributor, click **Create Distributor**. To create a sub-distributor of another distributor, click the **\+ Add** button in the parent distributor row. See [this page](page.aspx?pageid=product_groups) for an explanation of all of the fields that can be set for each distributor.

To assign a product to a distributor, open that product under **[Products > Manage Products](page.aspx?pageid=manage_products)**, open the product in the grid view and use the **Distributor** dropdown on the Main tab to set the product's distributor.
