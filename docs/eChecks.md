      eChecks are available in the checkout when used with either the Authorize.net or eProcessingNetwork Payment Gateways.  
  
The eCheck option must be enabled in the payment gateway account setup as well as the cart.

1.  In the \[Company Name\] admin console, go to **Configuration > Site Setup Wizard** and check the box next to E-Checks through supported gateway in the Credit Cards & Other Payment Methods section, then click **Save**.  
      
    
2.  Go to **Configuration > Settings** and search for the **StoreCCInDB** setting. Set the value to **Yes**.  
      
    
3.  It will then be shown in the Payment Info page as one of the payment methods:
