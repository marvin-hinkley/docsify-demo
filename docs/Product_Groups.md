This dropdown allows you to select the XML Package used to display this entity on the front end. The list displays all entity.\*\*\*.xml.config packages present in the XmlPackages folder.

Quantity Discount Table

If any quantity discount tables have been created, you can assign one to this entity here. This discount will apply to all products in this entity or any sub-entities of it.

Page Size

If the entity contains products or sub-entities, this value determines how many of them to show per page.

### Images

Image Filename Override

In this field, you can specify a filename (with extension) to use for this entity's images, instead of the entityID.jpg format that the software will generally use. If this field is populated, the other fields on this tab will be disabled so that images cannot be uploaded through this page. Images will have to be properly named and manually FTP'd to the site.

Icon

This field allows you to browse to and upload an icon-sized image.

Medium

This field allows you to browse to and upload a medium-sized image.

Large

This field allows you to browse to and upload a large-sized image.

Note: See [here](default.aspx?pageid=image_resize_configuration) for information on configuring the software's image resize tools.

### Summary

Information entered on the Summary tab is not actually displayed anywhere on the front end. This can be used for internal notes, special instructions, etc. This tab uses the Telerik RAD editor, and can accept HTML code. To insert HTML, click the “<>” button at the bottom of the editor.  

### Description

 ![](images/1415994457950.png)  
  
The Description tab is where general entity information is entered. All of this information will be displayed to customers at the top of entity pages. This tab uses the Telerik RAD editor, and can accept HTML code. To insert HTML, click the “<>” button at the bottom of the editor.  

### Custom Fields

### Store Mapping

 ![](images/1415994597098.png)  
  
If multiple stores are configured, this tab allows the store administrator to determine which entities are visible on which stores.

### SEO

 ![](images/1415994616870.png)  
  
The fields on the Search Engine tab are used to generate the “meta” information for your entity pages. This information is part of what most search engines use to index your site's pages, so you should take the time to put good information here.  

### Products

 ![](images/1415994665709.png)
