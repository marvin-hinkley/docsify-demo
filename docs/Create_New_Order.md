      title: Create New Order
      ---

      From the **Orders** Menu, click **Create New Order**.  
  
The Create New Order page allows store administrators to create orders for their customers without having to have password information. This can be handy for customers who don't wish to register, or for large sites that uses CSRs to place orders over the phone, and for catalog-only sites.   
  
To place an order, first find the customer account by searching by Last Name, E-mail, Customer ID, or an Order Number, or click the **Create New Customer** button to register a new account.

Once you've selected a customer or created a new customer account to use, verify that the account information displayed is all correct. If it needs to be corrected (or if this is a new customer), enter all the correct details and click **Update Customer**. Once the information is all correct, click the **Use Customer** button to start the order.

If the customer is in a [customer level](default.aspx?pageid=customer_levels) you will see the same products and prices they would if they were browsing the site. Navigate to the products they want and add them to the cart exactly as the customer would, then PCI guidelines suggest that in the interest of maintaining security you exit the order, contact the customer and ask them to log in and checkout. If you are using the [Smart One Page Checkout](http://www.aspdotnetstorefront.com/p-188-smart-one-page-checkout.aspx), this should not be an onerous process. If, however, it is vital for you to process the financial transaction on behalf of your shopper, then please use the **Checkout** button to proceed through the usual checkout process.

It is very important to use the **Cancel Order** or **Done Order** buttons to leave the phone order process. Do not just navigate to another area of the admin console without clicking one of those 2 buttons first.
