      title: Payment Methods
      ---

      The software supports several methods of payment. To enable a payment method, go to [Configuration > Site Setup Wizard](default.aspx?pageid=site_setup_wizard) in the admin console and check the boxes next to the method(s) you wish to allow customers to use. See [here](default.aspx?pageid=order_processing) for more detailed information on how to process orders paid for with the various payment methods.   
  

**Credit Card** 
================

This payment method allows customers to enter their credit card information and pay without leaving your site. This is the most common payment method, and is usually the simplest to manage as most of the work is done by the payment gateway.

**PayPal Express Checkout** 
============================

PayPal Express takes customers away from your site to pay through their PayPal account . The link appears on the shopping cart page, giving the shopper clear choice about where to checkout). Funds are transferred directly to your own PayPal account. This option is probably the world's single most popular payment method. See [here](default.aspx?pageid=paypal) for more information on PayPal's services and setting them up in the store.

Use PayPal Express Checkout to streamline checkout, decrease shopping cart abandonment and boost sales by opening the door to over 90 million active PayPal users who look for and trust this fast, easy secure way to pay. See [here](https://merchant.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=merchant/express_checkout) to sign up quickly and easily for PayPal Express Checkout. 

**PayPal Standard** 
====================

PayPal Standard appears as an option on your final payment page. If customers opt to pay that way, they are taken off of your site and sent to PayPal's site to pay. This method of payment is cheaper than most payment gateways, but notification of new orders can be unreliable. Completion of an order depends on customers using the 'Return to Merchant' button after completing payment on PayPal's site. If they do not click that button, or the redirect fails, your site may not be notified of the order (though it will be recorded in your PayPal account). It is highly recommended that you use the [Instant Payment Notification](default.aspx?pageid=paypal_standard_instant_notifications) with PayPal Standard. See [here](default.aspx?pageid=paypal) for more information on PayPal's services and setting them up.

PayPal Payments Advanced
========================

**  
\[Company Name\] software supports PayPal Payments Advanced. This service allows customers to pay using either a credit card or their PayPal account without leaving your site. Payment information is entered in a form hosted by PayPal and embedded on your checkout page. Your site never touches payment information, which simplifies PCI compliance, and your customers are able to use their PayPal accounts to pay without the extra steps of paying through another site.

**Checkout by Amazon** 
=======================

Checkout by Amazon is a payment method that combines your site's normal checkout process with Amazon's secure offsite payment information collection and verification. Customers initiate checkout on your site, and choose from your site's normal shipping methods on-site, but credit card information is entered on Amazon's site through a separate window that opens 'on top of' the store site. See [this page](default.aspx?pageid=checkout_by_amazon) for details on enabling this payment method.

**Request for Quotes** 
=======================

This method does not actually collect any payment information from customers. Store admins will be notified of the new order, and must then provide the customer with quote/pricing information (generally through email, though this can be handled however is desired as it is done outside of the software) for the products that were 'ordered'.   
  
**

Purchase Orders
===============

**Purchase orders are often used for government agencies or large businesses. Rather than paying directly through your site, they will request that you send them a PO, and they'll send the payment back however you work out. Most of the order processing is handled outside of the software.   
  

**Check** 
==========

Checks are very rarely used for online transactions, but they can be enabled if desired. Note that if you decide to use this method, you need to make sure that the address to send payment to is prominently displayed on your site and the receipt.   
  

**C.O.D.** 
===========

There are 4 C.O.D. payment methods (C.O.D., C.O.D. (Money Order), C.O.D. (Company Check), and C.O.D. (Net 30)) but aside from the displayed name they all function almost the same.  The difference to remember is that only normal C.O.D. is supported on Smart One Page Checkout.  
  
With Cash on Delivery orders, products/services are paid for in full with cash or certified check immediately at the time of delivery, or when they are received by the buyer. As with checks and purchase orders, most of the order handling is done outside of the software.  
  

**eCheck** 
===========

The Authorize.net & eProcessingNetwork payment gateways support eChecks, which essentially work the same way paper checks do. Only sites using those gateways will be able to use this payment method.   

**MicroPay** 
=============

Micropayments are pre-paid accounts that work only on your store site, similar to phonecards or giftcards. A customer can put in an initial amount and when it is used up, add more to it. Micropayments also save in merchant transaction fees by cutting down the number of transactions, since only adding funds to the micropay account requires running a live transaction through a gateway - all other micropay transactions stay on your site. See [here](default.aspx?pageid=micropay) for more information on using MicroPay.
