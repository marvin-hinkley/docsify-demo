      What does "Google" mean?
========================

You are currently reading a page which focuses on some changes made to inventory management as part of the roll-out of AspDotNetStorefront 9.4.2 and connected with the DotFeed feed to Google's shopping engine.

Ideally, you want to pass every possible product/variant/item combination to Google, even if it will be held in a 'not yet searchable' line until the item is back in stock. This column tells you whether or not your product/variant will make it to Google's merchant center.
