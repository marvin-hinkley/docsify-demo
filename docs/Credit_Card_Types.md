      ---

      From the **Configuration** Menu, click **Credit Card Types**.  
  
On this page, you can add/remove credit card types that your site will accept. The card types listed here will be visible to your customers on the payment page during checkout, and will be sent to the payment gateway if processing live transactions, so they must be valid card types.  
  

Adding a new credit card type might require customization of the gateway code. Please contact your developer for assistance.
