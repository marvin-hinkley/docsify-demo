      title: Google Trusted Stores
      ---

      The Google Trusted Stores program puts a badge on your site stating that your store meets certain criteria for customer service, which increases customer confidence, and also provides your customers with purchase protection during checkout.  See [Google's page](http://www.google.com/trustedstores/) for more information.  
  
Until late January 2015, it was only possible for a store-owner to gain the coveted 'Google Trusted Stores' badge by setting up a feed of orders, shipments and cancellations. Google wanted to gather information to monitor the performance of all the Trusted Stores in terms of fulfilment dates.  
  
Recently, however, those rules about 'feeding' have been relaxed and now the requirement is solely to embed two sets of tracking on your store. One set positions the badge, and the other records orders.  
  
To setup Google Trusted Stores you should first know that there is a minimum requirement of 200 orders per month per domain. If you are recording enough orders, then you can apply for a badge.  
  
Within your admin console, you should navigate to Configuration>Settings and filter for Settings that contain the string 'trusted'.  
  
  
The settings are:  
  

 **Setting Name**

 **What you should know**

 GoogleTrustedStoreBadgePosition

 This setting will give you some control over the relative position of the badge on your store.

 GoogleTrustedStoreCountry

 When you register for a Google Trusted Stores badge, you will need to tell Google the identity of the primary country served by your store. This setting must match your application.

 GoogleTrustedStoreDeliveryLeadTime

 Google evaluates your level of 'trust' by working to ensure that you generally deliver 'on time' - where the timing is declared by your own intent. This setting allows you to tell Google of your anticipated delivery time. Aim to be as accurate as possible (where delivery is typical days to release, added to the average days in transit.

 GoogleTrustedStoreEnabled

 If you want details from the order confirmation page to be transmitted to the center for Google Trusted Stores, then this is where you 'turn it on'.

 GoogleTrustedStoreID

 This is provided to you by Google.

 GoogleTrustedStoreLanguage

 The language in which you are selling must match the country you submit to Google.

 GoogleTrustedStoreProductIdentifierEnabled

 The writing seems to be on the wall ... Google is 'allowing' you to submit, along with your order information, the identifier of each item that was sold, as long as it is a product that is being 'fed' to Google Shopping. If you would like to make that connection, then set this to TRUE (recommended).

 GoogleTrustedStoreProductIdentifierFormat

 This identifier should match (says Google) the identifier of a product that you are feeding to Google Shopping. If you are using DotFeed, then this will be the productID followed by the variantID and we have set that as your default.

 GoogleTrustedStoreProductSearchID

 This is your Account ID from Google's Merchant Center for your shopping route.

 GoogleTrustedStoreShippingLeadTime

 Google evaluates your level of 'trust' by working to ensure that you generally ship 'on time' - where the timing is declared by your own intent. This setting allows you to tell Google of your anticipated shipping time. Aim to be as accurate as possible.

  
  
Once you've accurately configured the "Google Trusted Stores" details, don't call us if the badge isn't showing up. Google currently has an evaluation period of 30 - 90 days before it will tell you if you qualify.
