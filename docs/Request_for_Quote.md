      title: Request for Quote
      ---

      This method does not actually collect any payment information from customers. Store admins will be notified of the new order, and must then provide the customer with quote/pricing information (generally through email, though this can be handled however they desired as it is done outside of the software) for the products that were 'ordered'.

1.  In the \[Company Name\] admin console, go to **Configuration > Site Setup Wizard** and check the box next to Request For Quote in the Credit Cards & Other Payment Methods section, then click **Save**.  
      
    
2.  It will then be shown in the Payment Info page as one of the payment methods.

3.  After the order is completed a confirmation will be received. The store administrator will need to contact the customer about the custom quote request.
