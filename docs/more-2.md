      What does "Display" mean?
=========================

If the owner of an AspDotNetStorefront store elects to set the value of the setting "DisplayOutOfStockProducts" to TRUE, then the value stored in the setting "OutOfStockThreshold" dominates. All products and variants will show up on the store, but any variant with a stock level which is less than the value of "OutOfStockThreshold " will be marked 'out of stock' and the shopper will not be able to purchase that product.

Note: Google does NOT want you to be feeding an availability value of 'in stock' for variants if your store shows them missing or out of stock. You don't want that either, since you'll be paying to drive traffic to a product that you can't sell.
