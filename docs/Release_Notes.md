Features that have gone away
----------------------------

  
During the build of AspDotNetStorefront 9.5, a positive decision was made to remove features that, for a number of reasons, were not felt to be right for inclusion. Reasons varied, and largely covered performance hits, legacy architecture and feature overlap.   
  
Our primary focus in 2015 is to deliver software that helps attract traffic, and we are delivering services (like [500+](http://licenseportal.aspdotnetstorefront.com/p-1210-500-program.aspx)) that support the 'more traffic' initiative. After all, we say, what use are more ecommerce features on a store that rarely gets visited? We would sooner be building a cart that helps make sales, than a cart that just wants more bells and whistles than the next guy.
