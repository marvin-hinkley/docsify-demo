      From **Configuration** Menu, click **Shipping Calculation**  
  
On this page, you can configure the way your store calculates shipping.  In the **Custom Shipping Calculations** section, click **View Shipping Methods**.

Real-time shipping methods and the fixed rates set up here cannot be mixed - your store can offer live rates from one or more of the major shipping carriers, or the custom fixed rates you set up as new Shipping Methods, not both.

Adding a Shipping Method
========================

**

To create a new shipping method, click the **Create** button and give your method a name, and click **Save**. If your store is set up to use multiple [locales](default.aspx?pageid=locale_settings), you can create a different name for each locale.

The name given to shipping method is just a label that's presented to your customers. It does not have to be a valid carrier shipping method name. “U.S. Ground Shipping”, “Local Pickup”, “Super Saver Shipping”, etc are all just as acceptable as “UPS Ground” and “2nd Day Air”

After the method is created, you can click **Edit**, and use the **Set Allowed States** with **Set Allowed Countries**, OR **Set Allowed Zones** buttons to configure where the new shipping method will be valid. This step only has to be done if you want to restrict certain shipping methods to certain areas, however if you ARE going to do this, be sure that every method has at least one valid state/country combination (or Zone for zone based shipping calculation methods) or it will not show up to any customers. For example, a shipping method that allows Florida but not United States will never appear. If none of your methods are configured for the address a customer registers with, they will be unable to complete checkout, so be sure to create methods for all regions you want to accept orders from.  
  
If you want to set your shipping methods per Zone, then all methods need to have all Countries/States cleared and only set for the proper Zones. When setting per Zone, you must use the Zone calculations in the Shipping Rates Table (Calculate Shipping By Weight & Zone or Calculate Shipping By Total & Zone)

Real Time Methods

This page lists all of the services that the shipping carriers have returned for your various customers in the past. Click the **Edit** button to change the Display Name. This is the value that will be shown to customers during checkout.
