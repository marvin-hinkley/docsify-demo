      title: Extended Prices
      ---

      Some sites need to vary prices by [customer level](default.aspx?pageid=customer_levels) in a more complex way than just a flat percentage or dollar amount off of the base price. Extended Prices allow store admins to set special prices for each product that can vary for each customer level.    
To set up extended prices on a product:

1.  Create your [product](default.aspx?pageid=manage_products), and any necessary variants.  
      
    
2.  Create [customer levels](default.aspx?pageid=customer_levels).  
      
    
3.  Map your product to whichever customer levels you need, on the **Mappings** tab in the admin console under **[Products > Manage Products](default.aspx?pageid=manage_products)**. Click **Save** to save the Mappings.  
      
    
4.  Click **Manage Variants**, and click a variant Name to edit pricing. Click **Define Extended Prices by Customer Level**.

5.  For each customer level, enter a customer level specific price in the **Extended Price** column, then click **Save** to apply the price changes.
