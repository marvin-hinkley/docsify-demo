      ---

      From **Configuration** Menu, click **Manage Gift Cards**.   
  
On this page, store administrators can monitor the purchases and usage of gift cards on their site. They can also create new gift cards and edit/disable existing ones.  
  
Use the **Filter** section to find a gift card by **Serial Number** or **First or Last Name**. You can also filter your search by **Type** of gift card: Physical, Email, or Certificate. See [here](default.aspx?pageid=product_types) for more information on the different gift card types.  
  

Usage
=====

Click **Usage** in the Usage History column in any gift card row to see a list of any purchases made with that gift card. Store administrators can also add/remove funds with the **Add Usage** fields and button.

Adding New Gift Cards
=====================

If set up as a product on the front end, customers can purchase gift cards (where they are prompted to enter any necessary information such as a recipient e-mail), which will be automatically generated and listed on this page. E-Mail type Gift Cards are sent to the recipient upon fund CAPTURE, physical and certificate types are manually created and shipped. Store administrators can also manually create new gift cards if desired, with the **Create Gift Card** button.

Gift Card Types
===============

Certificate
-----------

Certificate gift cards are printed out by store administrators (usually on some kind of card stock or normal paper) and mailed to the purchaser. This allows them to contain any text and be any design that the store owner wants. Store administrators generate and assign serial numbers to these types of gift cards manually.  
  

Physical
--------

Physical gift cards work like certificate cards in that store admins generate the serial numbers and assign them to the card through this page, and the gift card is mailed to the purchaser. These types are generally used for plastic gift cards like the ones commonly seen in stores, though how the card is physically created does not actually matter.  
  

Email
-----

Email gift certificates are the only type that is sent to the recipient automatically (once payment is collected). The email is generated by notification.emailgiftcard.xml.config, which can be customized. By default, customers receive a simple text notification of the receipt with a link to the store and the gift card serial number (which is automatically generated).  
  

Using a Gift Card
=================

Customers use a gift card by entering the serial number in the box on the shopping cart page:

Customers can check the balance on their gift cards on the account.aspx page, but only AFTER the card has been used once on that account.
