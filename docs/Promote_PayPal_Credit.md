Once you have enabled a PayPal payment method which includes PayPal Standard or Express, you can enable PayPal Credit financing banners throughout your site:

1.  In your \[Company Name\] admin console, navigate to **Configuration > Promote PayPal Credit**.
2.  Ensure that "PayPal is enabled." is displayed in step 1. If not, then be sure to enable [PayPal](default.aspx?pageid=paypal) first and return to this setup. Otherwise, check the box for **I agree to the terms and conditions for PayPal Banners** after reviewing the terms and conditions found at the link.
3.  Click the button labeled **Get Your PayPal Publisher ID** and follow the onscreen steps to login to your PayPal account. Once you log in, you will see your PayPal Publisher ID. 
4.  Copy the Publisher ID to the clipboard and paste the ID into the **PayPal Publisher ID** text box.
5.  Click the button labeled **Save Your Publisher ID** button.
6.  Now you can go through and configure your banners for the following pages:
    *   Home Page
    *   Shopping Cart
    *   Product Pages
    *   Entity Pages (Categories, Manufacturers, Departments)
7.  Using the drop down you can select from a number of pre-formatted banner ads to suit your page styles best. A preview of the selected banner appears below each setting.
8.  Click the **Save Configuration** button to save your configuration.
