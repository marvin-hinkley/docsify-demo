      title: Disclaimers
      ---

      There are 2 ways to force customers to agree to text on your site before checking out: 1) the disclaimer, and 2) the terms & conditions page.

Disclaimer
==========

If enabled, this forces customers to agree to your disclaimer before they can even view the site at all. When they first go to your URL, a disclaimer page will load and display the contents of the **SiteDisclaimer** [](http://manual.aspdotnetstorefront.com/p-381-manage-topics.aspx)[topic](default.aspx?pageid=topics) and customers will be forced to click an **Agree** or **Disagree** button. The following [Settings](default.aspx?pageid=settings) control disclaimer behavior:  
  

**Setting Name**

**Description**

SiteDisclaimerRequired

Setting this to true enables the disclaimer.

SiteDisclaimerNotAgreedURL

This is the URL customers will be sent to if they click the 'Disagree' button.

SiteDisclaimerAgreedPage

This is the page on your site that customers will be directed to if they click the 'Agree' button.

Terms & Conditions
==================

If this feature is enabled, customers will have to check a box in agreement to your terms and conditions on the payment page during checkout. Those terms are set in the **CheckoutTermsAndConditions** [topic](default.aspx?pageid=topics). To enable this feature, set the **RequireTermsAndConditionsAtCheckout** [Setting](default.aspx?pageid=settings) to true.
