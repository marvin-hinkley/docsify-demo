      ​This page would welcome a sponsor from the \[Company Name\] community.  
Where is the product display order important? Well, within \[Company Name\] every product has at least one 'child' (called a variant). When a product has more than one variant, then the order in which they appear on a page can be really important ... like this:

Where else? Products are listed on pages by 'brand' (manufacturer) and by category. How do you want them to show up? Most expensive at the top? Bestsellers first? Perhaps it's just about the images and the placement of similar colors or photos:

  By default,  \[Company Name\] displays products in alphabetical order. Store administrators may wish to alter that display order. To do that, follow the steps below.

Product Display Order within Category (repeat for Department, or Manufacturer)
==============================================================================

To change product display orders:

1.  In the \[Company Name\] admin console, go to **Products > Product Groups**. (You will land on the product group that is a 'category' but in the top right hand corner you can switch and manage departments, or manufacturers.) Click a product group name that contains products you'd like to change the display order on.  
      
    
2.  Click the **Products** tab.  
      
    
3.  Click **Display Order**.  
      
    
4.  Edit the display order for the products you would like to rearrange, then click the **Save Display Order** button, then click the **Save and Close** button.

Variant Display Order within Product
====================================

Test yourself: Do variants have their own: (1) Images? (2) descriptions? (3) inventory levels? (4) display pages?  Find the answer [here](default.aspx?pageid=miscellany).

To change variant display orders:

1.  In the \[Company Name\] admin console, go to **Products > Manage Products** and select a product that contains variants you'd like to change the display order on.  
      
    
2.  Click the **Manage Variants** button.  
      
    
3.  Change the  **Display Order** by keying into the text boxes:
